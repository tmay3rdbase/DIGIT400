<p>Although this site focuses on memes in the digital sense, they were not always online. Memes have developed and grown over time to make the leap from analogue to digital. In addition, memes now take on an new definition than they once did in their early stages of existence. What started as jokes and ideas, fruitioned into physical properties that have been shared virally. Over time, memes have met their own changes and development as times have changed. They have gone from the most intellectual and meaningful digital artifacts, into a way of life and speech. They have gone from something rare, to something individuals see on a daily bases. This page will take you through examples from pre-internet, analogue, memes to digital memes.</p>

<p>Like the example used in the last page, Kilroy is an example of a pre-internet meme. Kilroy was a meme that stood for unity, security, and hope. This sense of unity can be seen through the actions this analogue meme has both caused, and prevented. A simple chalk drawing of this meme written on a wall has even been a way to peacefully end an anti-American rally in China <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This strong symbol stood as a reminder of the support that was given to the China by the America during instances like the Chinese Civil War. This shows a stronger meaning of support and dedication because it references the actions that the Americans had taken to come to the aid of Chinese civilians. The symbol was a way to end the anti-american rally, because of this. Another meaning these memes contain is security, or lack thereof. As one can assume, because of this meme's unifying themes, it was also used as a form of mystery. There have been references where there was a war ship that had been inspected before bombed, after they inspected the ship later it contained the Kilroy meme on it <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158" target="_blank">[2]</a>. This seemed virtually impossible since there was no record of anyone being able to get close enough to the vessel, as it needed to be cleared to venture towards <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158" target="_blank">[3]</a>. This incredible feat is what surrounded memes at this period. It was the unknown about them. The last effect these memes portrayed is a sense of hope. There was a story told by a nurse on a fleet ship that told of this inscription showing up on the deck of the tyrant in charge at the time <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158" target="_blank">[4]</a>. This allowed for the soldiers that were under him to suddenly feel a sense of morale that they had been missing <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158" target="_blank">[5]</a>. This sense of unity and hope was only possible because it exploited the power that the tyrant in charge possessed.</p>

<h3 class="text-left bounceIn">Digital Memes:</h4>

<p>Post internet memes have not had the same meaning behind them as their analog counterparts. Instead of portraying and physical presence of meaning, these memes give the individual joy and humor. They have developed into a ighly flexibleform of communication and comedy. These memes are not ones utilized to imitate but rather remix the culture in new contexts. Wiggins and Bowers state, “We define Internet memes as spreadable media that have been remixed or parodied as emergent memes which are then iterated and spread online as memes” <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1461444814535194" target="_blank">[6]</a>. These memes do not have a singular or particular meaning, but instead they are a form of parody or satire. They are meant to build from each other and mthey encourage users to make their own versions. This is what causes them to viral. Wiggins and Bowers also state, “Their staying power is likely due to the ease by which members of participatory digital culture can remix and spread image macro memes” <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1461444814535194" target="_blank">[7]</a>. This quote illustrates the power of remix culture that memes in a digital society has on virality of digital context. The only way for memes to survive in society is to have the chance and option to be varied and utilized personally as well as on a macro level.</p>

<p>Comedy, Satire, and Parody drive our digital culture today and memes are the most well-known and rapid way of doing so. Memes are being created and discovered daily with Spongebob, for example, serving as the central content for a whole range of communicative acts online. People tend to use the images this popular television show and utilize them to make fun-loving memes that everyone will know and understand. Using Spongebob in particular also helps because it is one of the most viral and long running cartoons in the history of television. Everyone knows the show and the characters. From elders to toddlers, this show happens to be one of the most famous and popular leading to the inevitable creation of memes. This form of communication is a seemingly never ending circle of comedy and satire that has developed over time to be a massive cultural phenomena. </p>
