<p>The psychology of memes are a perplexing issue that has roots in their comedic origins. However, this new style of communication could be having a negative effect on more than just humor: “...natural language can be construed metaphorically as akin to an organism whose evolution has been constrained by the properties of human learning and processing mechanisms". <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/memes-shape-brains-shape-memes/F218D0A11320BCC517BBD9BA6F028D8B" target="_blank">[1]</a> The quote before illustrates that linguistic changes and biological changes happen hand in hand with each other. This can be seen throughout society and in today's cuture. The length and sophistication of communication between individuals has been on a steady decline and memes are adding to this ever-changing language. Words change non-stop, but now we no longer use words that have the power; it is images, phrases, GIFs, and videos that guide our convorsations. Conversations can be had without a single deep thought because of the help that memes provide.</p>

<p>Being a college student, I constantly see the means of communication changing around me. At one point, I remember my parents worrying about how texting was affecting my intellectual ability and the language of my generation. However, memes have taken that degredation a step further. You can now make a whole conversation from memes. They have become a means of greeting, farewell, ice breaking, joke telling, and even adding overall context. I catch my friends and peers using these memes to socialize and interact. They use memes when they are both cracking jokes and just talking to each other. They use memes all of the time. Memes have taken over conversations that create personal connection. Now we do not have to worry about what we are going to say to eachother, as long as you know a meme you will be fine talking to someone.</p>

<h3 class="text-left bounceIn">Meaning Behind the Meme:</h3>

<p >When we look at photo memes there is a sort of analysis that goes into the making of it. An individual has to choose the right picture and be inspired enough to make it into a meme. This hypersignification is an image based term that describes this process <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1470412914546577 " target="_blank">[2]</a>. This term illustrates the multiple meanings behind an image or photograph and, when compared to a meme, is completely relatable. As an example, people choose one of the meanings that an image could carry and comment about this in order to show how they felt about the image they saw. The can supply their interpretation of a given context or photograph. Self-interpretation is the main point behind memes themselves. The memes are to show individual ideas and contexts on a personal and macro level. When someone creates a new meme from the same photo they are simply utilizing their own interpretation of this Hyper-Significant medium. The alternate interpretations allow for a deeper connection to be made and allows for a personal side of them to be interpreted from other individuals.</p>

<p>Memes are a means of communication that are used to portray emotions, purpose, and unity. They are what allow the socialization of today’s culture. As a mass form of communication, memes are a way of conveying themes and ideas inside a culture of individuals. Memes utilize the Hyper-Significant aspect of images to communicate across countries and nations to unite those who are seemingly different. They can bring popularity or shame, and with the number of non-users dwindling, they are becoming increasingly popular. Eventually, memes will one day become a universal language that everyone will understand and benefit from.</p>
