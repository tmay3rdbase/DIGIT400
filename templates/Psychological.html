<p>The psychology behind memes are a perplexing issue that has roots back the comedic aspects behind them. However, this new style of communication could be having a negative effect on more than just humor. “...natural language can be construed metaphorically as akin to an organism whose evolution has been constrained by the properties of human learning and processing mechanisms” <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/memes-shape-brains-shape-memes/F218D0A11320BCC517BBD9BA6F028D8B" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This illustrates that linguistic changes and biological changes happen hand in hand with each other. This can be seen throughout society and in today's cuture. The communication between individuals has been on a steady decline and memes are adding to this everchanging language. Words change non stop but now we have moved into a day and age where it is no longer words that have the power, it is images and phrases, and GIFs, and Videos. Conversations can be had without a single deep thought being conceptualized because of the help that memes provide.</p>

<p>“Being a college student myself I constantly see the means of communication changing around me. At one point in time I remember my parents worrying about how texting was affecting the intellectual ability and language of my generation. However, memes have take that a step further. You can now make a whole conversations from memes. They have become an aspect of greeting, farewell, ice breaking, joke telling, and overall context. I catch my friends and peers utilizing these memes to socialize and interact. This is whether they are just cracking jokes or talking to each other, they use memes all of the time. Memes have taken over conversations that create personal connection. Now we do not have to worry about what we are going to say to eachother, as long as you know a meme you will be fine talking to someone.” - <i>Taylor May</i></p>

<h3 class="text-left bounceIn">Meaning Behind the Meme:</h3>

<p >When we look at photo memes there is a sort of analyzation that goes into the making of it. An individual has to choose the right picture or gain an inspiration through it to make it a meme. This hypersignification is an image based term that describes this process <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1470412914546577 " target="_blank">[2]</a>. This term illustrates the multiple meanings behind an image or photograph and, when compared to a meme, is completely relatable. As an example, people choose one of the meanings that an image could carry and comment about this in order to show how they felt about the image they saw. The can supply their interpretation of a given context or photograph. This is the main point behind memes themselves. They are to show individual ideas and contexts on a personal and macro level. When someone creates a new meme from the same photo they are simply utilizing their own interpretation of this Hyper-Significant medium. This allows for a deeper connection to be made and allows for a personal side of them to be interpreted from other individuals.</p>

<p>In conclusion, memes are a way of communication that is used to portray emotions, purpose, and unity. They are what allows the socialization of today’s culture. Heading the communication, memes are a way of conveying themes and ideas inside a culture of individuals. This communication form utilizes the Hyper-Significant aspect of images to communicate across countries and nations to unite those who are seemingly different. They can bring popularity or shame, and the number of individuals who do not use them are becoming less and less. It is my personal prediction that, eventually, this will one day become a universal language that everyone will understand and benefit from.</p>
