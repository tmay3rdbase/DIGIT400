This meme is regarded as one of the first internet memes in the world. It not only started a world of viral memes, but also created a category of spin offs of its very basis. This meme was the influence behind commercials like Baby Spiderman, Pepsi Next Baby, and E-Trade-Baby <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/a-brief-history-of-the-dancing-baby-meme/" target="_blank">[2]</a>. This made 1996 a year that would change the way internet was used completely by introducing them to the world of memes.

        This meme is approximated to have started in 1997; however, it is hard to be sure. The basis around the usage of this meme, and why it came into effect, was Youtube videos and photographs on social media outlets. The “trolls” who started this meme, would try to be the first person to comment on something. They would usually either try this on media that was heavily trafficked or rarely trafficked. If the form of media was heavily trafficked, this meant that it was a competition to be “FIRST!”. If the media was a non-popular instance than the comment was meant to be a troll.

        The “Pancake Rabbit” is an internet sensation that took the world by storm in 2000 when someone decided to balance pancakes on a rabbit’s head. This spiraled a spread of images balancing other random objects on various rabbits’ heads. The most viral instance of this may have come from a Twitter page made for a rabbit name Vinny <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/17/stuff-on-rabbit_n_3086899.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>. The owner of this rabbit has, and still does, post photos placing various items from ice cream cones, to toilet paper rolls, on the rabbit. He makes sure these balance and then snaps a picture. Once it is uploaded, it is added to the dynasty of photos sparked by the original Oolong Pancake Rabbit.

        This meme/video/song like many others was taken by storm and it all started from a simple gif. A .gif file is a file that allows for movement instead of being a static image. A man known as Trym Stene or Tierre created this dancing Banana gif in 2001 <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/04/02/peanut-butter-jelly-time/7194151/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. In 2002, the gif had gained its own slogan. It had gained the phrase “Peanut Butter Jelly Time” and from then on, it became a hit. Soon there became a song to accompany this meme. This song is also called “Peanut Butter Jelly Time” by The Buckwheat Boyz <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=peanut+butter+jelly+time+song&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS759US759&oq=peanut+butter+jelly+time+song&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.9703j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">[2]</a>. The song further propelled the fame of this meme. Not long after the song came out, the song was soon remixed by the Ying Yang Twinz that skyrocketed the meme.

        This meme is a tragic one at heart. Light Saber Kid was a teen who was interested in star wars and AV club. This meme derived from him clumsily playing around with a pretend light saber practicing his moves. He left this video carelessly in the AV room when his classmates decided to post it online <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2323081/Boy-internet-memes--Star-Wars-Kid--breaks-silence-tell-taunts-contemplate-suicide.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>. As anyone can imagine, this would tear up a teen inside and kill all his hopes and ambitions going forward. It not only did this, but it made him the laughing stock of the entire school. He began to be bullied and this eventually caused him to begin contemplating suicide <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2323081/Boy-internet-memes--Star-Wars-Kid--breaks-silence-tell-taunts-contemplate-suicide.html" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This meme continued becoming viral as people added special affects to his light sabers and it even ended up on Tosh.0. Tosh.0 is a long running Comedy Central show focusing on making fun of videos from the internet <a href="http://www.cc.com/shows/tosh" target="_blank">[2]</a>.

        Epic Fail is a meme that started in 2003 to point out the ridiculously stupid things that people do. These stupid things could be intentional or unintentional but none-the-less they will be captured by a photograph and posted as a fail. The best memes from this genre are the fails that are done by businesses. These are like when cameras are placed behind signs, when writing on the streets are misspelled, or when things are built incorrectly <a href="http://www.epicfail.com/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. These are especially funny because when you see the photo, you understand that these took a while to do. If they took a while to do them and still did not notice it was wrong, they must have been unintelligent.

Chuck Norris is most known for his work done with the actor Bruce Lee. He also did a long run of commercials for the BowFlex workout station.

        Crazy Frog, or The Annoying Thing, is an internet sensation that started out in 1997 when a young swedish gentleman by the name of Daniel Malmedahl imitated an engine noise and it took the internet by storm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog" target="_blank">[1]</a>. After this he was asked to be on radio stations and pretty soon this made him blow up. In 2003, another swedish native Erik Wernquist created an animation for the sound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This animation was named Crazy Frog and this is when it began to make it big. After the animation and sound were paired it allowed for Crazy Frog to eventually go on to make 3 albums, appear on an Australian tour, and eventually strike it big by being placed into a game in 2005 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Frog" target="_blank">[1]</a>.

        The Diabeetus guy also known as Wilford Brimley is an American Actor who has had many large roles <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley" target="_blank">[1]</a>. However, nobody notices these because of his partnership with Liberty Mutual. His famous or <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#2006">MORE</button> infamous commercial for Liberty Mutual showed him in his home talking about his Diabetes. The reason this became a meme was because of how his accent sounds. This did not become huge overnight, the time at which this meme really struck it big was in 2006 when the YTMND <a href="http://ytmnd.com/" target="_blank">[2]</a> website started seeing an influx in web pages made for this specific meme. This meme has also caused many spin-offs to be mad such as, v for vendetta and dyinfeetus.

        This meme is possibly one of the most known and popular memes of all time. This meme is derived from the song Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This developed into a common meme and phrase called Rick Rolling. This is when, instead of sending them what they need, the song pops up and automatically plays the song. This meme virally spread because of it’s trolling nature. People could play jokes and tricks on each other by sending links of things that had this song playing instead. This song is also regarded as just a bad song which is why it was probably used. People can identify it by the first 5 seconds of it because of it so virally spread.

        This popular meme is one of the most financially beneficial memes of history. Also, this could be regarded as one of the lowest grade memes aswell. This meme was made by a bored college student in paint. This image skyrocketed and many people used it both online and in real life. This meme became the new hot thing and by 2010, Ramirez had to copyright it <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-maker-of-the-trollface-meme-is-counting-his-money-1696228810" target="_blank">[1]</a>.

        This puppeted feline is known for his stiff piano playing ability. The meme became famous because people love animals. This video, recorded in 2007, became popular in 2009 by Stephen Colbert on The Daily Show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_Cat" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This led the meme to be spoofed many times by people being “Played off” by the keyboard cat the same way they would be by a traditional band. However, this meme does not only stay in the realm of television. This meme also made its debut in various video game titles. Some of these titles are Scribblenauts, World of Warcraft, and Splinter Cell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_Cat" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This meme went extremely viral and even made for some lawsuits.

       Death hoaxes are a meme that became big because of the gullibility of individuals and the satirical nature of CNN. Certain celebrities would be selected to be given a death post on facebook or on CNN. This causes panic and remorse to circulate the internet until everyone figures out that it is a prank/lie. This meme is still present today with the most recent being Kirk Douglas in December of 2017 <a href="https://www.snopes.com/kirk-douglas-death-hoax/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. These claims can often be bluntly false or connected to a close injury that may have happened. For example, in June of 2017 it was said that Bob Barker passed away. He had suffered a head injury, however he was still alive and stabile.

       Condescending wonka is a meme that derives its popularity purely off of rudeness. This meme is one that has been derived from “You must be new here”, a meme based on a satirical introduction <a href="https://butteryobread.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/condescending-wonka-an-brief-analysis-of-the-internet-meme-and-its-uses/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. From that point on, Gene Wilder has been used to mock and mimic thousands of individuals through the screen shot from the 1972 version of Willy Wonka <a href="https://butteryobread.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/condescending-wonka-an-brief-analysis-of-the-internet-meme-and-its-uses/" target="_blank">[1]</a>. The facial expression of Wilder is one that was meant to be seen as happy, but when people put certain phrases with it, make it seem more satirical.

       This is a hilarious meme sparked a fairy tale of a class clown gone viral. This photo is a class photo of highschool junior Kyle Craven that did not actually make it into his yearbook <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/being-bad-luck-brian-when-the-meme-that-made-you-famous-starts-to-fade-away/2015/01/05/07cbf6ac-907c-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html?utm_term=.1ec84e49d0a9 " target="_blank">[1]</a>. This photo was rejected by his school and he was forced to take another. However, his friends and himself decided to photocopy the gold that we know so that when he handed it in they would not lose another copy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/being-bad-luck-brian-when-the-meme-that-made-you-famous-starts-to-fade-away/2015/01/05/07cbf6ac-907c-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html?utm_term=.1ec84e49d0a9 " target="_blank">[1]</a>.  This photo circulates a hilarious class photo of a kid who had a weird look on his face. This meme worked off of the facial expression to show a false sense of happiness with a pain feeling behind. Individuals would utilize this photos to make posts like, “Gets concert tickets… Green Day”. This shows his fake happiness that he got tickets because they were to a bad band such as green day.

      Grumpy cat is a meme thats name derives from the context behind it. It is a depiction of angry looking cat that usually has block writing that depicts an unenthused phrase. This photo was posted to reddit in 2012 and reached stardom in 2013 when Tardar Sauce’s picture was seen with block text all over the internet containing satirical phrases <a href="https://www.grumpycats.com/about" target="_blank">[1]</a>. This unbelievably adorable yet angry looking cat has been mimicked a lot by plenty of other cats and other animals, but none of them seem to the amount of appraisal that has been seen by this unenthusiastic feline. She obtained enough praise that her family actually started a website that talks all about her. More can be seen about this not-so-friendly feline <a href="https://www.grumpycats.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

      Kermit is a friendly and lovable puppet who stars on the muppets shows and movies. However, this meme plays upon a drinking photo of kermit that comments upon the stupid things that people do. The meme always ends with a standard phrase at the bottom that reads, “But thats none of my business”. This non-confrontational meme can be thought of as quietly or passive-aggressively mentioning the questionable circumstance. It is meant to be a frontliner of sarcasm. The history of this meme started in January of 2014 with the viral spread of a hashtag called #kermitmemes that soon blossomed into the meme we know today which include our loveable muppet in his full passive-aggressive nature <a href = "https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-kermit-sipping-tea-meme-a-history-of-this-muppets-shade-69015 ">[1]</a>. This allowed for the transition from the traditional sarcasm of influxed voices and facial expressions and became a widely known sarcasm tool.

      This meme/song was made to point out obvious liars. This hilarious song paired with the ridiculous faces and dances makes for a hilarious call-out on the side of whoever uses it. This meme is used against those who are fake. What is meant by this, is that the individuals that are talking are pathological liars and/or overreact about issues. It is also utilized when cheaters are talked about. One of the most interesting things about this meme is that it is often used as a gif or as music. There are very few memes that utilize the music. This one, for instance, says everything that it needs to say within the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcWM_1hBu_c ">song</a> itself. Do not be caught on the receiving end of this meme, because then everyone will know, that “you always lyin’”.

       Primitive spongebob is a meme utilized when someone needs to point out how shook something makes them. This is an image that depicts an alarmed and startled spongebob who has the brain of a pea. This species of Spongebob is one that is easily confused and disgruntled which is why this meme is heavily used. This can be utilized in the event of a surprise or alarming moment. It is an outward expression of an inward feeling that can easily be portrayed through the meme of a timeless cartoon. A lot of the time it is used multiple times within the same image to show how it is not just one individual that is confused but everyone. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZAGlNHnT3c">video</a> shows the moment in the cartoon series where this meme came from.

       This meme it utilized to mock the words of an individual in an argument. Just like the way people would do as a kid. This meme writes in a way that you would talk to mimic and make fun of the kid you were picking on at recess. This image comes from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy2XTN5gdzU ">episode</a> of Spongebob where Squidward finds Spongebob’s diary and uses it to mess with spongebob and send him into a mode where he clucks like a chicken. This image was taken when he does this to show a mocking image while text makes fun of someone. It is usually combined with a text that alternates, kind of sporadically, with capital and lowercase text. This is to show the inflection in the vocal speaking that is interpreted by our brains when we see the text.
