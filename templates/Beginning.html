<p>Humanity has survived on the back communication. It is the key to the survival of any great society and drives its connections. With that being said, there is a time in communication when you have to be serious and when it is alright to laugh a little. Memes are a subject that developed from the comedic side of communication. They were derived to be satirical and light hearted. They were utilized as a way to not only communicate but make each other laugh and smile. They were and still are used as a communication method for conveying themes and ideas back and forth among individuals.</p>

<p>Memes were not always meant to be a word associated with pictures and images. Richard Dawkins had invented this term to explain cultural jumps in evolution <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1461444814535194" target="_blank">[1]</a>. Within the next decade this word formed into a new meaning,however, throwing aside the previous contexts it was once known for. Memes now-a-days reference a viral image or post that give the illusions of meanings and are meant more for amusement than a selfish thought striving for survival <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/full/10.1177/1461444814535194" target="_blank">[2]</a>. This concept, itself, has evolved into a physical/digital iteration instead of an idea that is passed on from generation to generation. The first physical iterations of this started as comics or images that were used to pass the time and lighten the mood. These images began to circulate and go viral creating the first memes before the internet ever existed.</p>

<p>Early memes such as “kilroy was here” were memes that evolved into graffiti but started from symbols of hope and unity. “In China, an anti-American riot was suddenly and peacefully broken up when a local police chief pointed to a faded ‘Kilroy Was Here’ chalked on the side of a building” <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158 " target="_blank">[3]</a>. This meme that was etched into stones all over the country during wars and battles all over the country is now seen as a symbol of unity. It is a reminder of the good that has been done and the difficulty spent to overcome this. There is another story speaking of this as well that comes from a ship that the military conducted the first nuclear Bomb tests on. It was stated the the ship was checked over before it was hit and that nobody was allowed to approach it until cleared by the Admiral. It was written that as they approached the ship they were in awe because, “For chalked in huge letters on the port side of the New York, were the words, ‘Kilroy Was Here.’” <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158 " target="_blank">[4]</a>. This iconic story is one of the most popular about unexplainable appearances of this meme and the morale boost that it gives. However, eventually the soldiers that were in these wars oversees, came back home and started spreading the message. It has even been said that there are signs of Kilroy all over the country in places unimaginable like the Statue of Liberty <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/1289743760/fulltextPDF/5452B5F5FA8348CFPQ/1?accountid=13158 " target="_blank">[5]</a>. This showed a theme of triumph and mystery that eventually would be worked out of memes entirely to make room for mindless usage and implementation.</p>

<p>The beginning of memes was truly a time of freedom and individualism that started from the soldiers at war who were quite literally gaining freedom. From there on out they brought back a piece of their wartime culture that stood for the same principles. This portrayal of mystery and triumph influenced the citizens of our nation to practice individualism and to stand behind something bigger than themselves. This is what memes do in today’s society. They allow for a bridge between individuals who may not be similar but share a common interest through this form of communication. Even if you come from a different city, state, or even country of someone, you can learn and grow together by this form of communication.</p>
