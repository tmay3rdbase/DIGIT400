# [Memeline.win](https://www.memeline.win) for DIGIT 400
## Penn State Behrend
### Digital Media, Arts, and Technology

This is a prototype site about memes made by **Taylor May** a student at [Penn State Behrend](http://behrend.psu.edu/).

## Libraries Used!

On the site memeline.win there are two main python libraries used in `search.py`:

`from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`

`import requests`

## Python Libraries
[Memeline.win](https://www.memeline.win) is hosted by the usual `__init__.py` file.

**However** above this it also incorporates two other python files:

`pages.py`

Which is my content management file that links all the webpages to the auto populated tab list in my `navbar.html`.

***AND***

`search.py`

Which incorporates the two python libraries to allow the user to input a word and search it on google images to bring back the image.

## Acknowledgements
I could not have accomplished all of this by myself. I want to personally thank my professor [Aaron Mauro](https://github.com/aaronmauro) and the [bootsnipp](https://bootsnipp.com/) user *_[andrewnite](https://bootsnipp.com/andrewnite)_* for the timeline layout that I tweaked.
Along with this, a huge helper in this has been the [getbootstrap site](https://getbootstrap.com/) for obvious basic page layout and navbar usage.
